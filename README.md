# Data Structures and Algorithms for Production Systems

This repository is dedicated to the study and practical application of Data Structures and Algorithms that can be used in professional production systems. 

Our goal is to not only provide code examples but also resources to evaluate them before use, and methods to measure their performance in real-world scenarios.

## Structure of the Repository

- `/DataStructures`: This directory contains examples of different data structures. Each data structure has its own sub-directory with code examples and a dedicated README file with the description, use cases, and performance analysis.
- `/Algorithms`: Similar to the DataStructures directory, this directory contains sub-directories for each type of algorithm, each with code examples and a dedicated README file with a description, use cases, and performance analysis.

## How to Use dsa-plus-plus

Feel free to browse through the directories and files. You can run the programs locally by cloning the repository and executing the files in your local development environment.

## Measuring Performance

One of the core aspects of this repository is not just understanding data structures and algorithms but also how to measure their performance. In the README file of each data structure and algorithm, you will find a section dedicated to its performance analysis.

Performance is evaluated based on time complexity and space complexity, and we'll often discuss the trade-offs involved. We also provide resources and methods to measure the performance of these structures and algorithms in production environments.

## Resources for Evaluation

Before choosing a data structure or algorithm for your production system, it's crucial to evaluate if it's the right fit for your particular use case. In the README file of each data structure and algorithm, you'll find a section called "When to use", which gives a brief overview of the scenarios where it is most effective.
